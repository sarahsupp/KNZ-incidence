                     Data set contains seasonal summaries (spring and autumn) of the
                        number of individuals of each species of small mammal captured (relative
                        abundance) on each grassland trapline. Each record contains year, season,
                        trapline and number of individuals captured of each species. These live trap
                        records are based on daily captures during two 4-day trapping periods in
                        spring (late February to early April) and autumn (early October to
                        mid-November) for each of 14 permanent traplines established on seven
                        fire-grazing treatments (two traplines per treatment). These seven
                        fire-grazing treatments include three sites that are grazed by bison (1
                        unburned, 1 annual burn and 1 4-year burn) and four sites that are not
                        grazed by bison (1 unburned, 1 annual burn and 2 4-year burn).

                             Location of Sampling Stations: Ungrazed, unburned -
                                020B; Grazed, unburned - N20B; Ungrazed, annual burn - 001D; Grazed,

                                burn - N04D Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled in autumn
                                (early October to mid-November) after most reproduction by small
                                mammals has occurred and before winter stress is significant and in
                                spring (late February to early April) before fire has occurred on
                                those sites to be burned that year to estimate both early spring
                                abundance and winter survival (difference in relative abundance
                                between autumn and spring). Variable Measured: Numbers of
                                individuals for each species of small mammal captured are recorded
                                on each trapline. Sex, reproductive condition and capture location
                                of each individual are recorded at each capture. Age, based on
                                pelage characteristics, is recorded for the two species of
                                Peromyscus at each capture. Body mass of an individual is recorded
                                only at the first capture in each trapping period. Methods:
                                Traplines: Small mammals are trapped on two permanent traplines in
                                each of seven treatment units. trapline consists of 20 stations with
                                an inter-station distance of 15 m and terminal stations (1 and 20)
                                at least 50 m from the boundary of the treatment unit. When
                                possible, each trapline was placed so that station 1 was in upland
                                (shallow soil) and station 20 in lowland prairie (deeper soil), and
                                so the two traplines within a treatment unit would include about 16
                                stations in upland, 8 stations across limestone outcrops and 16
                                stations in lowland. Because of the topographic goals, the two
                                traplines within a treatment unit are not replicates of each other
                                and the topographic goals were not always achieved. Stations 1, 5,
                                10, 15 and 20 on each trapline are marked with stakes of galvanized
                                conduit. All stations are marked with fluorescent orange plastic
                                surveyor flags at least once per year. Trapping Procedures: Small
                                mammals are trapped for 4 consecutive nights per trapline during
                                each trapping period. Two large Sherman live traps (7.6 by 8.9 by
                                22.9 cm) are placed within 1 m of the surveyor flag or conduit at
                                each station. Traps are baited with a mixture of high-quality creamy
                                peanut butter (e.g., Jif) and oatmeal (Quaker old-fashioned
                                oatmeal). The mixture is rolled into a small ball (1.5-2.0 cm in
                                diameter) and wrapped in a 10-cm square of weighing paper. The bait
                                is suspended in the trap by closing the back door of the trap on the
                                twisted end of the weighing paper. Polyester fiberfill (5 g) is
                                compressed by a #8 rubber band and used as nesting material in each
                                trap in spring and autumn sampling periods. This nesting material
                                reduces trap mortality in inclement weather. With the nest material
                                and a large amount of bait in each trap, mammals typically are in
                                good condition at the time that trap are checked in all types of
                                weather. In the event that more than 50% of the traps are closed
                                overnight without an individual captured (e.g., due to strong winds
                                or other weather events such as heavy rain, deer licking traps or
                                raccoons or crows setting off traps), traps are set for additional
                                nights until < 50% of traps per night are closed without captures
                                on that trapline. Small rocks are placed on traps in habitats that
                                have little cover (e.g., on grazing lawns created by bison) to
                                reduce problems due to wind. During the two trapping sessions each
                                season, bison are removed from the phase II area of the bison
                                enclosures to avoid damage to traps (e.g., stepping or rolling on
                                them) and impacts on trap effectiveness (bison nuzzling or licking
                                traps) and to ensure safety of field personnel. All traps are
                                checked early each morning, but after the end of the nocturnal
                                activity period. Seven traplines are run simultaneously, one in each
                                treatment, followed by the setting of the next series of traplines
                                in the next week. The first trapline to be trapped in each treatment
                                unit is selected at random by using a random number generator. The
                                time of trapping in each season is selected by attempting to place
                                the dark phase of the moon (no moon) in the middle of the two
                                sampling periods. A battery-powered mustache clipper is used to clip
                                a line of fur on each captured animals to indicate that that
                                individuals has been captured in the current trapping period. The
                                position clipped is as follows: on the right shoulder (first set of
                                traplines in a spring sampling period), left shoulder (second set of
                                traplines in a spring sampling period), right rump (first set of
                                traplines in an autumn sampling period) and left rump (second set of
                                traplines in an autumn sampling period). This method of marking
                                allows an investigator to count an individual only once within a
                                trapline during a trapping period. Further, three species of rodents
                                (Peromyscus maniculatus, P. leucopus and Neotoma floridana) are
                                marked with an ear tag (#1 monel fingerling tags) in each ear in
                                addition to fur clipping to track movements of individuals among
                                treatment units that are related to fire or to invasion of woody
                                vegetation. Species, sex and reproductive condition of individual
                                small mammals, trap station and any unusual features (e.g., the
                                presence of ticks, fleas or bot fly larvae, variation in color
                                pattern such as stars or blazes) are recorded at each capture of an
                                individual in each trapping period. Body mass is recorded during the
                                first capture of an individual on a trapline. Reproductive
                                information recorded for males is the presence or absence of scrotal
                                testes. Pregnancy is determined by palpation of the abdomen of
                                females; no effort is made to assess the number of embryos. Presence
                                or absence of conspicuous mammae also is recorded. Conspicuous
                                mammae indicate that the female has been reproductively active and
                                is nursing or has nursed offspring. Individuals are weighed to
                                nearest 0.5 g for those weighing < 50 g and nearest 1 g for those
                                weighing > 50 g by using Pesola balances of an appropriate size.
                                Form of Data Output: The total number of mammals captured by species
                                by trapline forms the database CSM01. Summary of All Changes: In
                                autumn 1981, two traplines were established in each of ten
                                experimental fire treatments (001D, 004B, 004D, 004F, 004G, 010A,
                                000B, N01D, N04D and N00D). Live-trap surveys were conducted in
                                spring, summer and autumn; small mammals were marked by toe-clipping
                                procedures. During winter 1981-1982, the Konza Prairie management
                                committee shifted treatment boundaries to create watershed units for
                                those treatment areas that drained into Kings Creek. Because of that
                                decision, our traplines in N00D were encompassed in the new
                                boundaries of N01D. Therefore, we established two new traplines in
                                another treatment unit (N00B) in spring 1982. Also, the experimental
                                designation for N01D was changed to N01B. During spring, summer and
                                autumn 1982, surveys were conducted using 22 traplines; use of the
                                two traplines in N00D was discontinued before the spring 1983
                                survey. Data for small mammals captured in N00D for spring, summer
                                and autumn sampling periods in 1982 are found in CSM06. From spring
                                1983 through summer 1984, censuses were conducted using two
                                traplines in each of ten treatments (001D, 004B, 004D, 004F, 004G,
                                010A, 000B, N01B, N04D and N00B). In autumn 1984, four new traplines
                                were established with two traplines in 002C and two in 002D (24
                                total sampling lines). Four more traplines were added in autumn 1985
                                with two in 010D and two in 001A (28 total sampling lines). After
                                1987, summer sampling was discontinued because of the intensive
                                labor required to close traps in the morning and open traps in late
                                afternoon each day on each trapline in each trapping period. All
                                data for small mammals captured in summer trapping periods are found
                                in CSM06. In 1988, Konza Prairie management committee changed
                                unburned research treatments to treatments with a 20-year frequency
                                of occurrence of fire and, therefore, 000B and N00B became 020B and
                                N20B, respectively. The treatment units (N01B and N04D) remained
                                unburned from 1968 until spring 1988 when annual burning was
                                initiated on N01B and the 4-year cycle was initiated on N04D. Spring
                                fires occurred after our trapping session in these and other
                                treatment units. N20B was not burned in 1988, but it had been burned
                                in 1980. Before the spring sampling period in 1989, the number of
                                traplines sampled was reduced from 28 traplines to 14; the 14
                                traplines remaining included two traplines in each of seven
                                experimental treatments (001D, 004B, 004F, 020B, N01B, N04D and
                                N20B). Selection of these 14 traplines was based on the goal of
                                maintaining the sampling of small mammals in annual, 4- year and
                                20-year burn treatments in both ungrazed prairie (001D, 004B and
                                020B, respectively) and in the same fire treatments in prairie
                                grazed by bison (N01B, N04D and N20B). In addition, a second
                                ungrazed 4-year fire treatment (004F) was continued to help monitor
                                climatic effects on small mammals in prairie experiencing periodic
                                fires. Data for small mammals captured on traplines that were
                                discontinued (001A, 002C, 002D, 004D, 004G, 010A and 010D) can be
                                found in CSM06. In autumn 1990, we started clipping hair at the
                                first capture of a small mammal in each season in exchange for the
                                more invasive clipping of <= 1 digit per foot, which had been
                                used since 1981 to identify individuals. Hair clipping allowed
                                enumeration of the number of different individuals per species
                                captured along each trapline, which was all that was required for
                                maintenance of the CSM01 data set. In autumn 2008, we started
                                ear-tagging deer mice, white- footed mice and eastern woodrats to
                                gain more information about how new fire treatments near the 14 core
                                traplines and how the invasion of woody vegetation was affecting
                                movements of these three species. In May 1992, gates were opened
                                between phase I and phase II of the bison area. N01B, N04D and N20B
                                lie within the phase II area. All sampling periods from autumn 1981
                                through spring 1992 on these three treatment units occurred on
                                traplines that had not been grazed by bison. For additional metadata
