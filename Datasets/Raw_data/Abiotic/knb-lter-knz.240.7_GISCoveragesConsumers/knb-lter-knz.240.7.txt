       These data show the sampling locations for the consumer datasets at Konza Prairie. GIS400 defines the starting points for sweep samples of grasshoppers across Konza Prairie. These data may be used in conjunction with the sweep sample datasets (CGR02). GIS401 defines the starting points for sweep samples of grasshoppers across Konza Prairie, focusing on grazing impact. These data may be used in conjunction with the sweep sample datasets (CGR02Z). GIS405 defines the trap locations for small mammal sampling across Konza Prairie. These data may be used in conjunction with CSM0X. GIS 406 defines the locations of small mammal host parasite sampling at Konza Prairie. These data may be used in conjunction with CSM08. GIS410 defines the stream stretches for fish sampling across Konza Prairie. These data may be used in conjunction with CFC01. These data are available to download as zipped shapefiles (.zip), compressed Google Earth KML layers (.kmz), and associated EML metadata (.xml).

        Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) is located on a 3,487 hectare native tallgrass prairie preserve jointly owned by The Nature Conservancy and Kansas State University. The KPBS is located in the Flint Hills of northeastern Kansas (39°05’ N, 96°35’ W), a grassland region of steep-slopes overlain by shallow limestone soils unsuitable for cultivation.
