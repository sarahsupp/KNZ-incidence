# Clean Data to Classified Incidence for All Taxa
This Rmarkdown is for taking the clean datasets for all 4 taxa (small-mammals, grasshoppers, birds, and plants) and using the incidence classification method to categorize each species. 

## Functions
This section is dedicated to the functions that will be applied to our datasets. 

### getTrends3.0
The "getTrends" function will classify each taxa's species from each watershed into distinct categories. This version of the function has the stipulations for 'Always_present' >=95% years present, 'Always_absent' <=5% years present, and for recurrent category requires at least 2 blocks of time when it is present. I also renamed some variables for clarity. The categories include: 
- **"No_change-absent"** <- though species was detected at other surrounding watersheds, it was absent at specified watershed for the duration of the time series.
- **"Rare"** <- Species was present at specified watershed for between 1-10% of years in the duration of the time series.
- **"No_change-present"** <- species at watershed is present in >=90% of years in which data was collected.
- **"Random"** <- species is detected sporadically for the duration of the study at watershed
- **"Recurrent"** <- species is detected in consecutive years and is followed by the absence of the species for a period of time, in a distinct pattern. Species must at least two instances of presences followed by absences. 
- **"Increasing"** <- the presence of the species increases throughout the duration of the study (it is absent during the beginning of the study, but appears towards the end of the study)
- **"Decreasing"** <- the presence of the species decreases throughout the duration of the study (it is present during the beginning of the study, but then disappears towards the end of the study)

getTrends3.0 <- function(x) {
  #input (x) is a single row of a matrix where the species are rows and the columns are each year with 1/0 values (1=present, 0=absent).

## Small-mammals (1992 - 2013) {.tabset}
### Small-mammals: Presence/ Absence & Incidence Classification
For this section, I am reorganizing the cleaned small-mammal data and reformatting it into a presence/absence matrix. This matrix will then be ran through the getTrends3.0 function to get the incidence classifications for each species at each watershed.

```{r smammals classification}

#Reading in the cleaned dataset

#Since I won't differentiate the data based on the trap lines or season, I am summing the data based solely on watershed.

### Small-mammals: Dissimilarity Between Watersheds *NEEDS FIXED*
This section is for conducting dissimilarity tests between watersheds for the small-mammal dataset. 

These dissimilarity tests will include a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the first year of the time series, a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the last year of the time series, a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the overall time-series, and a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity test for the overall time-series.

```{r smammals dissimilarity}

##Creating a data frame with the outputs, having the watershed pairs as rows (one column is the first watershed, the second column is the watershed it is being compared to, and the third column is contains the dissimilarity values).

### Grasshoppers: Dissimilarity Between Watersheds
This section is for conducting dissimilarity tests between watersheds for the grasshopper dataset. 

These dissimilarity tests will include a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the first year of the time series, a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the last year of the time series, a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the overall time-series, and a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity test for the overall time-series.

## Birds (1992 - 2009) {.tabset}
### Birds: Presence/ Absence & Incidence Classification
For this section, I am reorganizing the bird data and reformatting it into a presence/absence matrix. This matrix will then be ran through the getTrends3.0 function to get the classifications for each species at each watershed.

The overall output is a dataset that includes the incidecne classification for each species at each watershed, and includes all other output from the getTrends3.0 function

```{r birds classification}

#Pivoting the the dataset wider, so that each species is its own column and each row is a year and watershed. This is to populate the dataset with NA's (which will become zeroes) for each species in each year. If species weren't observed, they weren't recorded, but we still want that to count as an absence and it needs to represented in the dataset.

### Birds: Dissimilarity Between Watersheds *NEEDS FIXED*
This section is for conducting dissimilarity tests between watersheds for the bird dataset. 

These dissimilarity tests will include a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the first year of the time series, a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the last year of the time series, a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the overall time-series, and a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity test for the overall time-series.
```{r birds dissimilarity}

### Plants Dissimilarity Between Watersheds
This section is for conducting dissimilarity tests between watersheds for the plant dataset. 

These dissimilarity tests will include a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the first year of the time series, a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the last year of the time series, a Jaccard's dissimilarity test for the overall time-series, and a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity test for the overall time-series.
