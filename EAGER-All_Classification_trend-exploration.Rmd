##Functions
This section is dedicated to the functions that will be applied to our datasets. 

###getTrends
The "getTrends" function will classify each taxa's species from each watershed into distinct categories, which include: 
- **"Always_absent"** <- though species was detected at other surrounding watersheds, it was never present at the specified watershed during the duration of the study
- **"Always_present"** <- species at watershed is present in every year in which data was collected
- **"Random"** <- species is detected sporadically for the duration of the study at watershed
- **"Recurrent"** <- species is detected in consecutive years and is followed by the absence of the species for a period of time, in a distinct pattern
- **"Increasing"** <- the presence of the species increases throughout the duration of the study (it isn't present during the beginning of the study, but appears towards the end of the study)
- **"Decreasing"** <- the presence of the species decreases throughout the duration of the study (it is  present during the beginning of the study, but then disappears towards the end of the study)

## Small-mammals (1992 - 2013) {.tabset}
This section is dedicated to cleaning and classifying the species for the small-mammal trapping dataset. 

Data was collected from 1981 to 2013, but we are only looking at data collected between 1992 to 2013 because bison weren't introduced to the bison plots until 1992.

---

Watersheds included in the raw dataset: 
1D, 4B, *4F*, 20B, N1B, N4D, N20B.
*italicized* = *watersheds excluded in our analysis*

Reasons for exclusion:
*4F* = Removed to have equal representation of comparable treatments; there are 2 watersheds with the 4-year fire-interval + ungrazed treatment (4B and 4F), and only one watershed with the 4-year fire-interval + grazed treatment (N4D). We removed 4F because 4B is more commonly sampled in our other datasets. We did do a Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity test between 4F and 4B after standardizing for the total number of observations per watershed and found they were ~9% dissimilar/~91% similar regarding small-mammal population.

Author: Donald Kaufman

ZIP file: knb-lter-knz.88.9

Data code: CSM01

File(s): 
- CSM011.csv <- The counts of species observed during their sampling periods at each watershed from 1981 to 2013.
- CSM012.csv <- Traits of the individual small mammals trapped, such as the mass, sex, relative age, pregnancy status, etc..

---

Summary of changes:
- During winter 1981-1982, the Konza Prairie management committee shifted treatment boundaries, so our traplines in N00D were encompassed in the new boundaries of N01D. Therefore, we established two new traplines in another treatment unit (N00B) in spring 1982.
- In autumn 1984, four new traplines were established with two traplines in 002C and two in 002D (24 total sampling lines). 
- Four more traplines were added in autumn 1985 with two in 010D and two in 001A (28 total sampling lines). 
- After 1987, summer sampling was discontinued because of the intensive labor required to close traps in the morning and open traps in late afternoon each day on each trapline in each trapping period.
- In 1988, Konza Prairie management committee changed unburned research treatments to treatments with a 20-year frequency of occurrence of fire and, therefore, 000B and N00B became 020B and N20B, respectively. 
- The treatment units (N01B and N04D) remained unburned from 1968 until spring 1988 when annual burning was initiated on N01B and the 4-year cycle was initiated on N04D.
- Spring fires occurred after our trapping session in these and other treatment units. 
- N20B was not burned in 1988, but it had been burned in 1980. 
- Before the spring sampling period in 1989, the number of traplines sampled was reduced from 28 traplines to 14; the 14 traplines remaining included two traplines in each of seven experimental treatments (001D, 004B, 004F, 020B, N01B, N04D and N20B).
- In addition, a second ungrazed 4-year fire treatment (004F) was continued to help monitor climatic effects on small mammals in prairie experiencing periodic fires
- Data for small mammals captured on traplines that were discontinued (001A, 002C, 002D, 004D, 004G, 010A and 010D) can be found in CSM06
- In May 1992, gates were opened between phase I and phase II of the bison area. N01B, N04D and N20B lie within the phase II area. 
- All sampling periods from autumn 1981 through spring 1992 on these three treatment units occurred on traplines that had not been grazed by bison.

### Small-mammals: Cleaning and organization
In this section, I read in the small-mammal data, check the data for errors, rename some columns and entries, choose the watersheds I want to further analyze, and separate the data from 1992 and onwards.

## Birds (1992 - 2009) {.tabset}
This section is dedicated to cleaning and analyzing the bird-sampling data set. 

Data was collected from 1981 to 2009, but we are only looking at data collected between 1992 to 2009 because bison weren't introduced to the bison plots until 1992.

Censuses are conducted two times during the year: during the first two weeks of January as a measure of wintering populations, and during the first two weeks of June as a measure of breeding populations.

---

Watersheds included in the raw dataset: 
1D, 4A, 4B, *4D*, 20B, *20C*, N1B, N4B, N4D, N20B, *R1B*, *R20A*, *LA*, *SA*, *GA*
*italicized* = *watersheds excluded in our analysis* 

Reasons for exclusion:
*4D* = This watershed turned into area SA in 1990 and was dropped from the dataset. **NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK**
*20C* = Removed to have equal representation of comparable treatments; there are 2 watersheds with the 20-year fire-interval + ungrazed treatment (20B and 20C), and only one watershed with the 20-year fire-interval + grazed treatment (N20B). We removed 20C because 20B is more commonly sampled in our other datasets. We did complete a Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity test between 20B and 20C after standardizing for the total number of observations per watershed and found they were ~23% dissimilar/ ~77% similar.
*R1B* = This watershed doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing; this watershed was burned every 20 years till 2000 and is now burned yearly.
*R20A* = Similarly to watershed R1B, this doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing; this watershed was burned yearly up till 2000 and is now burned every 20 years.
*LA, SA, GA* = These are not watersheds. They are gallery forest and forest edge areas located in lower King's Creek, north fork, and upper Shane's Creek at Konza. Since they are forest locations and don't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing, we dropped them.

Summary of changes up to 1993 (this is all that was included in the metadata): 
- 1981: Transects were as presently located except no transect in N20B and there were transects in  N20C (now N01A), N20D (now part of N01B), N01C (now N02B), N01D (now part of N01B), and N04C (now N04B). 
- 1982: Transects in N20C (N01A) and N01C (N02B) were dropped, N20D was maintained in what is now N01B. N01D became the second transect in what is now N01B, and N04C transect was maintained in what is now N04B. N20B was added. 
- 1990: 004d became SA and transect was dropped.

## Grasshoppers (2002 - 2020) {.tabset}
This section is dedicated to cleaning the grasshopper sweeping dataset. 

Data was collected from 1982 to 2020, but we are only looking at data from 2002 to 2020 because sampling at the bison plots was suspended from 1985 - 2002.

---

Watersheds included in the raw dataset: 
*B*, *NB*, 1D, *2C*, *2D*, 4B, *4D*, 4F, *4G*, *10D*, 20B, *N1A*, N1B, N4A, N4D, *N20A*, N20B, *SpB*, *SuB*
*italicized* = *watersheds excluded in our analysis*

Reasons for exclusion
*B* = Although not stated in the metadata for this dataset, it is mentioned in the metadata of the small-mammal dataset that this watershed was converted into watershed 20B in 1988.
*NB* = Again, though not mentioned in the metadata for this dataset, the small-mammal metadata mentions that this watershed was converted into watershed N20B in 1988.
*2C* = This watershed doesn't have a grazed counterpart, and thus doesn't have a fair comparison in terms of disturbance treatment.
*2D* = This watershed also doesn't have a grazed counterpart, and thus doesn't have a fair comparison in terms of disturbance treatment.
*4D* = This watershed was converted into watershed SpB (or, according to the Birds dataset, it was converted into area SA -- a forest area)
*4G* = This watershed was only temporarily added in 1986 and eventually became watershed WB instead, which is a watershed that is burned annually in the Winter.
*10D* = This watershed was converted into watershed SuB, which is a watershed that is burned every 2 years in the Summer.
*N1A* = Removed to have equal representation of comparable treatments; there are 2 watersheds with the 1-year fire-interval + grazed treatment (N1A and N1B), and only one watershed with the 1-year fire-interval + ungrazed treatment (1D). We removed N1A because N1B is more commonly sampled in our other datasets. We did do a Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity test between N1A and N1B after standardizing for the total number of observations per watershed and found they were ~16% dissimilar/ ~84% similar regarding grasshopper population.
*N20A* = Similarly to N1A, we removed this watershed to have equal representation of comparable treatments; there are 2 watersheds with the 20-year fire-interval + grazed treatment (N20A and N20B), and only one watershed with the 20-year fire-interval + ungrazed treatment (20B). We removed N20A because N20B is more commonly sampled in our other datasets. We did do a Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity test between N20A and N20B after standardizing for the total number of observations per watershed and found they were ~16% dissimilar/ ~84% similar regarding grasshopper population.
*SpB* = Not included because it doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing. This watershed is an experimental plot that is burned annually in the Spring and exists to compare how burning in different seasons can affect ecological processes. 
*SuB* = Not included because it doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing. This watershed is an experimental plot that is burned annually in the Summer and exists to compare how burning in different seasons can affect ecological processes.

ZIP file: knb-lter-knz.29.20

Data code: CGR02

File(s): 
- CGR021.csv <- Environmental data that was taken from the grasshopper sampling sites. Information includes wind speed, air temperature, and cloud cover.
- CGR022.csv <- The species count data we will use for our classification and analysis. 
- CGR023.csv <- Additional information on the individual grasshoppers caught, including the instar stage and sex. 

---

Summary of changes: 
- 1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
- 1985:Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August.  Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB)), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued. 
- 1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling. 
- 1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F. 
- 1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August. 
- 1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D. 
- 1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year. 
- 2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 
001D A: T-28; 
004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 
020B A: N-29; B: N-29 
- 2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%. 
- 2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar. 
- 2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September. 
- 2018: March 14. 004B – A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, “C”, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per “normal” schedule.

## Plants (1992 - 2022) {.tabset}
This section is dedicated to cleaning and analyzing the plant species composition/cover dataset. 

Data was collected from 1983 to 2022, but we are only looking at data collected between 1992 to 2022 because bison weren't introduced to the bison plots until 1992.

---

Watersheds included in the raw dataset: *1A*, *1C*, 1D, *2C*, *2D*, 4A, 4B, *4F*, *20A*, 20B, *20D*, *N1A*, N1B, *N2A*, *N2B*, N4A, N4D, *N20A*, N20B, *R1A*, *R1B*, *SpA*, *SpB*, *SuA*, *SuB*, *FA*, *WA*, *WB*

*italicized* = watersheds we excluded in our analysis
Reasons:
*1A* = Not sampled in enough years; only sampled in 4 years
*1C* = Also no sampled in enough years; sampled in 17 years, mostly before 1992
*2C* = Does not have an adequate counterpart for comparison. The grazing counterpart for these watersheds were only sampled 3 times.  
*2D* = This watershed was converted into watershed SpB, which is a watershed that is burned annually in the Spring. **NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK THIS**
*4F* = Not sampled in enough years; only sampled in 8 years
*20A* = Not sampled in enough years; only sampled in 4 years
*20D* = Not sampled in enough years; only sampled in 8 years
*N1A* = Removed to have equal representation of comparable treatments; there are 2 watersheds with the 1-year fire-interval + grazed treatment (N1A and N1B), and only one watershed with the 1-year fire-interval + ungrazed treatment (1D). We removed N1A because it was sampled from 1993 onwards, while N1B was sampled from 1992 onwards. We did do a Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity test between N1A and N1B after standardizing for the total number of observations and converting the cover numbers into more discrete numbers based on the half-point in their percent cover range and found they were ~39% dissimilar/ ~61% similar regarding plant population.
*N2A* = Not sampled in enough years; only sampled in 3 years.
*N2B* = Not sampled in enough years; only sampled in 3 years.
*N20A* = Removed to have equal representation of comparable treatments; there are 2 watersheds with the 20-year fire-interval + grazed treatment (N20A and N20B), and only one watershed with the 20-year fire-interval + ungrazed treatment (20B). We removed N20A because it was sampled from 1993 onwards, while N20B was sampled from 1992 onwards. We did do a Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity test between N20A and N20B after standardizing for the total number of observations and converting the cover numbers into more discrete numbers based on the half-point in their percent cover range and found they were ~35% dissimilar/ ~65% similar regarding plant population.
*R1A* = This watershed doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing; this watershed was burned every 20 years till 2000 and is now burned yearly.
*R1B* = This watershed doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing; this watershed was burned every 20 years till 2000 and is now burned yearly.
*SpA* = Not included because it doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing. This watershed is an experimental plot that is burned annually in the Spring and exists to compare how burning in different seasons can affect ecological processes.
*SpB* =  Not included because it doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing. This watershed is an experimental plot that is burned annually in the Spring and exists to compare how burning in different seasons can affect ecological processes.
*SuA* =  Not included because it doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing. This watershed is an experimental plot that is burned every 2 years in the Summer and exists to compare how burning in different seasons can affect ecological processes.
*SuB* =  Not included because it doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing. This watershed is an experimental plot that is burned every 2 years in the Summer and exists to compare how burning in different seasons can affect ecological processes.
*FA* =  Not included because it doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing. This watershed is an experimental plot that is burned annually in the Fall and exists to compare how burning in different seasons can affect ecological processes.
*WA* = Not included because it doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing. This watershed is an experimental plot that is burned annually in the Winter and exists to compare how burning in different seasons can affect ecological processes.
*WB* = Not included because it doesn't fit into the disturbance framework we are assessing. This watershed is an experimental plot that is burned annually in the Winter and exists to compare how burning in different seasons can affect ecological processes.

Summary of changes:
- Pasture c01b was called Texas Hog (thp) in 2009. 
- Vegetation species composition from 1983: The transects were permanently laid out in the current format of 4 transects (A-D), each with 5 plots. 
- Transect E only occurred on watershed N20B florence in 1986 and 1987. This transect is the same as the current transect D for this watershed and soil type. 
- The old transect D was abandoned in 1987 prior to bison reintroduction. 
- Seven cover classes were used to estimate species canopy coverage. 1 - 0-1% cover; 2 - 2-5% cover; 3 - 5-25% cover; 4 - 25-50% cover; 5 - 50-75%; 6 - 75-95% cover; 7 - 95-100% cover. -(Note: for the watershed r20b, no data were collected in the transect A and B in the fall of 2011 due to wildfire occurred.) 
- Transect 'E' occurred only on the N20b florence site in 1986 and 1987 and was renamed the new 'transect' in 1988. 
- The old 'D' transect was sampled from 1983 to 1987 and then abandoned when the bison fence was constructed. 
- Thus, plots d1-d5 from 1983-1987 are NOT the same d1-d5 plots in subsequent years.
