                     Data set contains seasonal summaries (spring and autumn) of the
                        number of individuals of each species of small mammal captured (relative
                        abundance) on each grassland trapline. Each record contains year, season,
                        trapline and number of individuals captured of each species. These live trap
                        records are based on daily captures during a single 4-day trapping period in
                        spring (mid-March to early April) and autumn (late October to early
                        December) for each of six permanent traplines established on two fire
                        treatments (three traplines per treatment). These two fire treatments
                        include one treatment that was changed from a 20-year burn to an annual burn
                        and one that was changed from an annual burn to 20 years between fires.
                        Bison do not graze these two habitat types.

                             Location of Sampling Stations: Ungrazed, unburned: R20A;
                                Ungrazed, annual burn: R01A Frequency of Sampling: Both sites are
                                sampled in autumn (late October to early December) and in spring
                                (mid-March to early April). Variable Measured: Numbers of
                                individuals for each species of small mammal captured are recorded
                                on each trapline. Sex, reproductive condition and capture location
                                of each individual are recorded at each capture. Age, based on
                                pelage characteristics, is recorded for the two species of
                                Peromyscus at each capture. Body mass of an individual is recorded
                                only at the first capture in each trapping period. Methods,
                                Traplines: Small mammals are trapped on three permanent traplines in
                                both treatment units. Traplines A and B on each treatment consist of
                                20 stations with an inter-station distance of 15 m. Trapline C on
                                each treatment has 10 stations with the same inter-station distance
                                as traplines A and B. Because of the limitations of size of
                                treatments and topography, our goal in this study was to have 100
                                trapnights within a treatment each night that we trapped. Stations
                                1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 on trapline A and B and stations 1, 5 and 10 on
                                trapline C are marked with stakes of galvanized conduit. All
                                stations are marked with fluorescent orange plastic surveyor flags
                                at least once per year. Trapping Procedures: Small mammals are
                                trapped for 4 consecutive nights per trapline during each trapping
                                period. Two large Sherman live traps (7.6 by 8.9 by 22.9 cm) are
                                placed within 1 m of the surveyor flag or conduit at each station.
                                Traps are baited with a mixture of high-quality creamy peanut butter
                                (e.g., Jif) and oatmeal (Quaker old-fashioned oatmeal). The mixture
                                is rolled into a small ball (1.5-2.0 cm in diameter) and wrapped in
                                a 10-cm square of weighing paper. The bait is suspended in the trap
                                by closing the back door of the trap on the twisted end of the
                                weighing paper. Polyester fiberfill (5 g) is compressed by a #8
                                rubber band and used as nesting material in each trap in spring and
                                autumn sampling periods. This nesting material reduces trap
                                mortality in inclement weather. With the nest material and a large
                                amount of bait in each trap, mammals typically are in good condition
                                at the time that trap are checked in all types of weather. In the
                                event that more than 50% of the traps are closed overnight without
                                an individual captured (e.g., due to strong winds or other weather
                                events such as heavy rain or deer licking traps), traps are set for
                                additional nights until less than 50% of traps per night are closed
                                without captures on that trapline. All traps are checked early each
                                morning, but after the end of the nocturnal activity period. All six
                                traplines are run during the same 4-day trapping period. Generally,
                                the reversal traplines are run after LTER core traplines and
                                seasonal fire traplines in both seasons. Thus the amount of
                                moonlight present during the trapping period is variable across
                                seasons and years due to cloud cover and moon phase for the reversal
                                traplines. A battery-powered mustache clipper is used to clip a line
                                of fur on each captured animals to indicate that that individuals
                                has been captured in the current trapping period. The position
                                clipped is dependent upon the trapline and occurs as follows: on the
                                right shoulder (on R01A-A trapline in a spring sampling period),
                                left shoulder (on R20A-A trapline in a spring sampling period),
                                right rump (on R01A-A trapline in an autumn sampling period) and
                                left rump (on R20A-A trapline in an autumn sampling period). For
                                traplines B and C on each treatment area, the upper back is marked
                                in an autumn sampling period and upper back in a spring sampling
                                period. The reason for this difference in marking position is that
                                the two A traplines are very close to each other and by marking the
                                animals captured differently, we can determine if an individual has
                                crossed the firebreak within a trapping period. Likewise, this
                                method of marking allows an investigator to count an individual only
                                once within a trapline during a trapping period. Further, three
                                species of rodents (Peromyscus maniculatus, P. leucopus and Neotoma
                                floridana) are marked with an ear tag (#1 monel fingerling tags) in
                                each ear in addition to fur clipping to track movements of
                                individuals among treatment units that are related to fire or to
                                invasion of woody vegetation. Species, sex and reproductive
                                condition of individual small mammals, trap station and any unusual
                                features (e.g., the presence of ticks, fleas or bot fly larvae,
                                variation in color pattern such as stars or blazes) are recorded at
                                each capture of an individual in each trapping period. Body mass is
                                recorded during the first capture of an individual on a trapline.
                                Reproductive information recorded for males is the presence or
                                absence of scrotal testes. Pregnancy is determined by palpation of
                                the abdomen of females; no effort is made to assess the number of
                                embryos. Presence or absence of conspicuous mammae also is recorded.
                                Conspicuous mammae indicate that the female has been reproductively
                                active and is nursing or has nursed offspring. Individuals are
                                weighed to nearest 0.5 g for those weighing less than or equal to 50
                                g and nearest 1 g for those weighing greater than 50 g by using
                                Pesola balances of an appropriate size. Form of Data Output: The
                                total number of mammals captured by species by trapline forms the
                                database CSM05. Summary of All Changes: We began trapping small
                                mammals along the permanent traplines in December 1999 before the
                                fire treatments were reversed. The treatment unit 001A (which was to
                                become R20A) was burned annually from 1972 through 2000. In spring
                                2001, it became a long-term unburned site except for an accidental
                                wildfire that occurred in spring 2008 after we had completed our
                                small mammal surveys. The treatment unit 020A (which was to become
                                R01A) was unburned except by wildfires in 1980 and 1991 before
                                annual spring burning began in spring 2001. Note that the traplines
                                on R20A are not the same as those used previously in 001A (CSM06).
                                At the beginning of the reversal of the fire regimes on these two
                                treatment units, we intensively trapped small mammals. From December
                                1999 through December 2001, we used two methods of individually
                                marking small mammals. On each small mammal, we both toe-clipped and
                                applied an ear tag to the right ear of an individual (except for
                                shrews). To uniquely identify an individual by toe clipping, we
                                removed at most 1 digit per foot. Ear tags (each with a unique
                                number) also were used, but ear tags are often lost, especially if
                                only one ear is tagged and, subsequently, the history of that
                                individual also is lost. These methods of marking allowed us to both
                                identify individuals across traplines on the two treatment units and
                                among trapping periods. Generally, both treatment units were trapped
                                before the spring fire in March or April and then after the spring
                                fire in May, June and then November-December from 2000 to 2002. We
                                continued the general trapping plan in 2003, but used hair-clipping
                                on different positions of the body to track small mammals among
                                different trapping periods. After 2003, hair clipping was solely
                                used as described above in the Methods and sampling occurred only in
                                the spring and autumn of each year. Hair clipping allowed
                                enumeration of the number of different individuals per species
                                captured along each trapline, but not individual recognition. In
                                spring 2008, we started ear-tagging deer mice, white-footed mice and
                                eastern woodrats in addition to hair clipping to gain more
                                information about how these different fire regimes are affecting
                                movements of these three species given the change in vegetation
                                since the beginning of the study. Small mammals were not trapped on
                                these traplines in autumn 2003 and spring 2009. For additional
