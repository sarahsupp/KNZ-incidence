## Setup and Overview

### **Setting up data for analysis**
#### This RMarkdown will be used for the inital data cleaning of the four biotic datasets in the EAGER Konza Temporal Incidence project. 

####The four datasets include bird sampling (knb-lter-knz.26.12 -> CB011.csv), grasshopper sweeping (knb-lter-knz.29.20 -> CGR021.csv & CGR022), small-mammal trapping (knb-lter-knz.88.9 -> CSM011.csv & CSM012.csv), and plant data- which includes biomass and species composition (knb-lter-knz.55.14 -> PAB011, and knb-lter-knz.69.21 -> PVC021.csv). All data were taken from the EDI Data Portal Repository. All are LTER datasets from Konza Prairie. Each dataset will have its own section for cleaning

###Libraries and Set-up

# Bird Sampling

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
